# AVOID EDITING THIS FILE for your local needs, as it's under source control! Instead, either:
# - Add your property value overrides to ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
# - Or use -P<name>=<value> gradle command line options, e.g. -Pfreemarker.allowUnsignedReleaseBuild=true

# JDK version used for compiling, except for Source Sets where a specific version is set in build.gradle.kts.
freemarker.javaVersion=8
# JDK version for running javadoc
freemarker.javadoc.javaVersion=16
# JDK version for running JUnit tests
freemarker.test.javaVersion=16

# Method used when generating the *.asc file, one of: none, gradle_properties, gpg_command
freemarker.signMethod=none
# - For gradle_properties, also set these somewhere:
#   signing.keyId=...
#   signing.password=...
#   signing.secretKeyRingFile=...
# - For gpg_command, you need GNU Privacy Guard installed, and you don't have to set anything if it's on the path.

# To allow building for a releasable version number when freemarker.signMethod=none. Only use for CI, and local testing!
#freemarker.allowUnsignedReleaseBuild=true

# To publish to the Apache Maven repo (for staging), somewhere you have to set these:
#freemarker.deploy.apache.user=<your user name at the ASF>
#freemarker.deploy.apache.password=<your regular ASF password>
